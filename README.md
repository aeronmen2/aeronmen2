### Hi there, I'm Alexis Duchemann! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior software developer passionate about creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. I love being creative and crafting beautiful experiences through code. Here's a little about what I'm up to:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects using Next.js and NestJS.
- ðŸŒ± I've learned React.js and JavaScript, and I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in these areas.
  
Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration, discussions, or just to say hi! ðŸ˜Š
